Hi Everyone! My name is Anutr Sivakoses and I am currently a second year PhD student studying Cancer Biology at the University of Arizona. I am currently being mentored by Dr. Alfred L.M. Bothwell, who just moved to the U of A not too long ago as well! Currently, our lab studies phenomena that lead to cancer cells avoiding immune surveilance and destruction. Specifically, we look at a process recently identified as cancer cell trogocytosis of immune cell membrane proteins, leading to immune system shutdown.\

I graduated in May of 2021 from the University of Nevada, Reno, with my B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology with a minor in Spanish Literature and Culture. While navigating my undergraduate studies, I was a research assistant in Dr. Heather Burkin's laboratory, where my project was to assist in designing and developing a three-dimensional model of smooth muscle myometrial tissue. I also was appointed a Pre-Professional Advisor under the university's Exploratory and Pre-Professional Advising Center, where I collaborated with incoming freshmen as well as current and returning undergraduate students in their professional and graduate school journey. I also had the opportunity to serve on various club and professional organization's executive boards.\

My personal passions beyond science are photography and teaching computer science and coding to newer and older generations. I currently have experience in teaching Java, Node.JS, Swift, Python, C++, and Visual Basic. I also have industrial experience in Swift, Python, and Java. I also currently hold a computer science certification administered by the Nevada Department of Education and the Advanced Technologies Academy in Las Vegas, Nevada.\

Using the skills and knowledge that I have earned from these postions as well as the privilege of being a Ronald McNair Scholar, I wanted to be able to provide graduate and professional school resources for not only getting in, but also surviving and completing your degree. Please join me on my personal journey as I work towards my PhD and I hope that I can help you along the way as well!
